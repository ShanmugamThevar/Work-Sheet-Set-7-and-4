    "Ans. Gradient Descent is the most common optimization algorithm in machine learning and deep learning. It is a first-order optimization algorithm. This means it only takes into account the first derivative when performing the updates on the parameters. On each iteration, we update the parameters in the opposite direction of the gradient of the objective function J(w) w.r.t the parameters where the gradient gives the direction of the steepest ascent. The size of the step we take on each iteration to reach the local minimum is determined by the learning rate α. Therefore, we follow the direction of the slope downhill until we reach a local minimum."

    "Accuracy fails on classification problems with a skewed class distribution. classification predictive modeling is practiced with small datasets where the class distribution is equal or very close to equal. Therefore, we develop an intuition that large accuracy score or small error rate scores are good, and values above 90 percent are great. Achieving 90 percent classification accuracy, or even 99 percent classification accuracy, may be trivial on an imbalanced classification problem. This means that intuitions for classification accuracy developed on balanced class distributions will be applied and will be wrong, misleading us into thinking that a model has good or even excellent performance when it, in fact, does not."
